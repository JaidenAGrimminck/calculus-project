                    <p>
                        For this project, my object was a cylinder-like object. I am unsure of its use, but it is a very interesting object.
                    </p>

                        For this object, lines can be used to outline it with accuracy.
                        Due to the perspective, the outline is shifted to lines and parabolic curves, making a more complicated shape.
                        The real graph is solely lines except for a small curve found by the neck, but the parabolic curves are used to make it look more accurate to the image.

                    <h1>3D Model</h1>
                    <p>
                        In the 3D model, I made it using 5 different cylinders.
                        I used 3 cylinders for the main body, and 2 for the ends.
                        I also used a disk for the curve near the "neck" of the object.
                        There are two different ways to evaluate it - the more complicated way, using the outline of the object, or using the actual representations
                        of the object. The more complicated way is actually less accurate, but it's more math intensive and interesting.
                        Using the acutal representations of the object is more accurate, which is why I'll solve for both.

                    <p>
                        In the graph, we can see that the object is rotated around the y-axis, and the crossections have a height of delta y.
                        We can then create our integrals in respect to y, and then solve for the volume.
                        This model is only accurate to the image, and assumes it's a solid object. This is using disc method.

                    <p>
                        Using the real represntations, we can make the following formula to calculate for the volume.
                        Due to the holes being different sizes and heights from the outside, we can simplify it down by making the holes all of their own 
                        expressions, and all of the outside of the object its own expression - the washer method, but in multiple integrals.
                        Once we calculate each of the volumes, we can subtract the holes from the outside to get the final volume.
                        This is essentially $r_{outer} - r_{inner}$, but with multiple outer radii and inner radii.
                        This can be proved with the following expressions, with $r_{inner}$ and $r_{outer}$ being some expression, and $a$ and $b$ being the bounds.

                    <p>
                        We can also prove that the washer method works with a hole of different bounds. 
                        Assume $a$ and $b$ are the bounds of the outer radius, and $c$ and $d$ are the bounds of the inner radius.
                        Also assume that:
                        \( a \le c \le d \le b \). Using the disc method, we can get the solid part of the shapes that has no hole, then add the bit with the hole, calculated using the washer method. 
                        Using what we proved on the previous slide, we can find the following:

                            = \pi \int_{a}^{c} r_{outer}^2 dy + \pi \int_{c}^{d} r_{outer}^2 dy - \pi \int_{c}^{d} r_{inner}^2 dy + \pi \int_{d}^{b} r_{outer}^2 dy \\
